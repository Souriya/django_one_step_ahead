# Django Project Starter Template, One Step Ahead

A production-ready Django starter template with pre-configured common apps including extended user profiles, Django Authentication, Django REST API, production-grade server that replaces the default `runserver`, and more.

## Overview

This template provides a solid foundation for building modern Django applications. It comes pre-configured with essential tools and settings, allowing you to focus on developing your application's core features rather than spending time on initial setup.

Key features:

* **Extended User Profiles:**  Easily manage and extend user information beyond the basic Django User model.
* **Django Authentication:**  A pre-configured and ready-to-use authentication system.
* **Django REST API:**  Integrated Django REST Framework for building powerful APIs.
* **Production-Grade Server:** Replaces the default `runserver` with a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI - *specify which one you use here*).  This ensures your project is ready for deployment.
* **[Add other key features here as needed, e.g., Testing setup, Static file management, etc.]**
