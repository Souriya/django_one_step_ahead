# Django Project Starter Template, the One-Step-Ahead Approach

A production-ready Django starter template with pre-configured common apps including extended user profiles, Django Authentication, Django REST API, production-grade server that replaces the default `runserver`, and more.

## Overview

This template provides a solid foundation for modern Django applications, pre-configured with essential tools and settings.  It streamlines development with an improved folder structure, environment switching between production and development, and more, allowing you to spend less time on boilerplate and better stucture when expanding your application in the furture.

Key features:

* **Extended User Profiles:** Easily manage and extend user information beyond the basic Django User model to collect more user information other than username, password, and email.
* **Django Authentication:** A pre-configured and ready-to-use authentication system, which most apps require so that you don't need to go through setting up Django core for Authentication every time you start a new Django project.
* **Django REST API:** Integrated Django REST Framework for building powerful APIs.
* **Production-Grade Server:** Replaces the default `runserver` with a production-ready WSGI server (CherryPy). This ensures your project is ready for production deployment.
* **CSS, JS, Icon, and Font Libraries:** Includes lightweight Google Material Design CSS, Google Material Icon library and Lao fonts.
* **Proction Setting and Development Setting:** Streamlines development workflows with separate settings files for production and development environments, easily switch between configurations.
* **Optional Docker Support:** Also include docker compose to simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across environments.
* **[Add other key features here as needed, e.g., Testing setup, Static file management, etc.]**
